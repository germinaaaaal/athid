> sandhi rules

>>internal sandhi
/ts/ becomes /s/
/ar/ becomes /aur/
plosives are voiced
[ʃ] and [ç] can not exist in the same word: /ç/ is realized as [ʃ].
[rd] morphs to [ɹd] (ɑr.da -> ɑɹ.da)

>>external sandhi
consonant gemination interrupted before a plosive
/n/ -> /m/ before a plosive:

 lehann + bassó  =  /lεham.bas:o/
/lεhan:/ /bas:o/

/m.d/ -> /n.d/

two non-diphthong vowels are seperated by a glottal stop
identical vowels ("biśwá áʒad") become a single geminated vowel
vowels that match a valid diphthong ("śeśawé ónntar") merge into
a single diphthong.
