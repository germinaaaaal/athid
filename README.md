a repository for the revitalization project of the conlang áthid.

# what is áthid?
**áthid: inspired by trees**
the conlang áthid was created as an artlanging experiment based on sylvan culture, with heavy influences from season changes and pagan traditions. this project constitutes a part and a database of the revitalization efforts.
The phonology of áthid is heavily inspired by Laádan (by S. H. Elgin), something you can plainly see from the many fricatives and use of [ɬ], and it features nasalized consonants inspired by my native language, French.
I am planning on using the language for my personal use in journaling and writing.
