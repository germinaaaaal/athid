> seasonal evidentials

seasonal evidentials give an indication on the time of the event on a seasonal
scale: simply put, they are particles that decline by season/time of year, and
by mood: indicative (the "base" mood), subjunctive (the "may" mood), and
conditional (the "whether" mood).

{note: these particles make for one of áthid's most
exotic notions and aims to satisfy the original design paradigms of áthid}

>> moods

as stated above, the moods of áthid are indicative, subjunctive, and
conditional. these two first moods are the "essential" moods, with the last
mood simply serving as a way to express the near future which is otherwise not
expressible in áthid {cf. verbs}

>> seasonal evidentials

the essential moods are expressed using the 'ná' and 'nńa' particles which in
turn decline according to season. the conditional particle is 'iʒa', and it is
invariable.

seasonal evidentials decline by:

         indicative   |   subjunctive
                      |
autumn       ná       |       nńa
----------------------|------------------
winter       nor      |       ńu

spring       néi      |       ńis
