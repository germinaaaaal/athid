> syntax

there are six parts of speech in áthid:
- verbs
- nouns
- conjunctions (introduce subsyntagms)
- adjectives
- seasonal particles (is the event occuring in autumn or winter, is it an
idea, wish, or truth, etc...)

>> essential syntax

áthid uses ergativity. this means the language concentrates on the experiencer
rather than the actor, an essential design paradigm.

the word order of áthid is aEVA (ablative-ergative-verb-absolutive). This would
be equivalent to an [C]OVS structure with [C] being the circonstancial
complement. thus,

"a bear eats honey in the shade" will be
"in the shade honey [is eaten by] a brown bear" which will be
"[this spring] in the shade honey [is eaten by] a bear that is brown"
"[néi] śewár idi - myeĺá - iýimor - berowáa - abóne."
néi śewár idi, myeĺá iýimor berowáa abóne.
spring shade.LOC  honey.ERG eat.PRS bear.ABS brown

>> verbs

transitive verbs are always translated as passive to retain word order.
intransitive verbs are translated freely.
verbs conjugate by tense and aspect.

the copula verb in áthid is ná náwa. it is invariable.
the verb ná dewá is used as an auxiliary for the perfect and pluperfect tenses.

>> nouns

nouns' cases are the ablative, the ergative and the absolutive. however, the
noun's place in a syntagm is also indicative of its function, which is likely
how the language was able to evolve invariable plurals (berowé-bérowá-bérowáa,
berowés plural for "bear").

>> adjectives

epithet adjectives come directly after the noun. they are invariable.
the verb 'na dewá' is used with adjectives ('the sky is blue') as attributes
like so: "the flowers are yellow" is 'ẃewannís ná śiśid dewá' (flowers are blue
being).

to turn an adjective into an adverb, it is possible to simply use the adjective
with the phrasing 'in a [adjective] tone', which is 'ićló ĺonaći é [adjective]'
in place of an additional ablative at the beginning of a syntagm.
